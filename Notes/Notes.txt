React Hooks
- Hooks are special functions that allows us to use state and other React
  features in functional components
- In react 16, we can now use state management and other react features without 
 writing class components
- Earlier, we create react app using functional components, there was no access to the 
state management and lifecyle methods
- To access these features we had to use class components

- simply hooks are functions that make functional components work like class components
